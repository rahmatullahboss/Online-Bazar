# Implemented Features

## Password Visibility Toggle

Password visibility toggle functionality has been added to both the login and registration pages:

1. **Login Page** (`src/app/(frontend)/login/page.tsx`):
   - Added eye icon button next to the password field
   - Clicking the eye icon toggles between password and text input types
   - Uses Lucide React icons (Eye and EyeOff)

2. **Registration Page** (`src/app/(frontend)/register/page.tsx`):
   - Added eye icon button next to both password fields (password and confirm password)
   - Clicking the eye icon toggles between password and text input types
   - Uses Lucide React icons (Eye and EyeOff)

## Google Sign-In/Sign-Up

Google authentication has been implemented for both login and registration:

1. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Added "Sign in with Google" button to the login page
   - Added "Sign up with Google" button to the registration page
   - Both buttons use Google's OAuth 2.0 flow
   - Includes Google's branded SVG icon

2. **Backend Implementation**:
   - Created API route at `src/app/api/auth/google/route.ts`
   - Handles OAuth callback and token exchange
   - Creates new users or logs in existing users
   - Uses `google-auth-library` for OAuth operations

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added Google Client ID injection via SiteHeader component
   - Created utility functions for accessing Google Client ID
   - Documented setup process in `GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md`

## Technical Details

### Password Visibility Implementation

- Uses React state to track visibility status
- Conditionally renders Eye or EyeOff icons based on visibility state
- Dynamically changes input type between "password" and "text"

### Google Authentication Flow

1. User clicks Google Sign-In/Sign-Up button
2. Frontend redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
3. Google redirects back with authorization code
4. Frontend sends code to our API endpoint
5. API exchanges code for access tokens
6. API fetches user information from Google
7. API either logs in existing user or creates new user
8. API returns authentication token and user data
9. Frontend redirects user to home page

### Dependencies

- `lucide-react` (already installed) - for Eye/EyeOff icons
- `google-auth-library` (needs to be installed) - for OAuth operations

### Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
